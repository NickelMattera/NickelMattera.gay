            I started climbing in March of 2022 after a good friend told me about it. I then moved up to Minnesota a few
            months later and, shortly after that, found out about OutClimb. Since joining OutClimb, I have expanded my
            climbing knowledge and experience from just climbing strictly indoors to climbing outdoors, setting up top
            rope anchors, sport and trad lead climbing, and much more.

                We are a Minnesota-based organization dedicated to making climbing accessible to as many trans and queer
                people as possible. We also foster a supportive community and promote diversity, equity, and inclusion
                within the outdoor recreation communities.

                I was an instructor for the Women, Trans, Femme beginner ice climbing clinic at the Sandstone Ice
                Festival. The clinic was an introduction to ice climbing that created space for women, trans and femme
                climbers.
